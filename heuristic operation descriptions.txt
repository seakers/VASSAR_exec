1. Duty Cycle - Penalizes satellites with duty cycle less than the threshold (0.5) [dc_sat = max(data_rate_dc, power_dc)]
	h_dc = max(0.0, (dc_threshold - dc_sat)/dc_threshold) (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
2. Instrument Orbit Relations - Penalizes architectures with instruments in incompatible orbits 
	(passive illumination instrument in DD orbit, chemistry concept instrument in PM orbit, slant geometry instrument in orbit of altitude <= 400 km)
	h_ior = sum of violations in arch/36 (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
3. Interference - Penalizes architectures that have interfering instrument pairs in the same satellite
	violations are added for each pair of interfering instruments if any instrument could be moved to a different orbit
	h_i = sum of violations in arch/10 (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
4. Packing Efficiency - Penalizes satellites with packing efficiency less than the threshold (0.4) [packeff_sat = max(packeff_mass, packeff_vol)]
	h_pf = max(0.0, (packeff_threshold - packeff_sat)/packeff_threshold) (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
5. Spacecraft Mass - Penalizes satellites with spacecraft wet mass less than the threshold (3000 kg) 
	h_sm = max(0.0, (sm_sat - sm_threshold)/sm_threshold) (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
6. Instrument Synergy - Penalizes architectures that have synergistic instrument pairs but in different satellites
	violations are added for each pair of synergistic instruments in different orbits
	h_syn = sum of violations in arch/10 (computed and averaged over all satellites in arch)
